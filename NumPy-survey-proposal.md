You know that NumPy is essential to the Python community. The NumPy team wants you to know that YOU, our user and developer community, are essential to us. That’s why we are putting together a team to create the inaugural NumPy Community Survey. We hope the feedback will provide insights that will help us to guide better decision-making about the development of NumPy as software and a community.

<h1>NumPy Inaugural Community Survey Proposal</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p><b>LISTEN</b> Invite all NumPy stakeholders to share their thoughts about NumPy as software and as a community project.</p>
<p><b>GAIN INSIGHTS</b> We hope the collected dataset will provide us with a better understanding of the ever-growing NumPy user 
and contributor community, their experiences with NumPy and within the entire open source ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>TAKE ACTION</b> Develop (or refine) policies, processes, and practices that will help to strengthen and grow 
the NumPy community.</p>


<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
The following principles will guide the inaugural NumPy Community Survey:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
<li>Sustained Action</li></ul>


<h2>Topics & Questions</h2>
<p>The survey should have up to 40 questions, mainly close-ended to allow easy processing, and take 5-10 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>This is an overview of the topics we would like to explore with the inaugural NumPy Community Survey:</p>
<p>Community Demographics
<br>Contribution
<br>Mentorship
<br>Project Priorities
<br>Future of NumPy</p>

<p>For more in-depth overview of the topics please refer to <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys/blob/master/NumPy-survey-topics.md">NumPy-survey-topics.md</a>.</p>

<h2>Translations</h2>
In order to reach out to the wider NumPy community, we would like to make the survey available in the following languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese and other languages.
Responses in English for the open questions will be encouraged for easy survey processing.


<h2>Survey Results</h2>
<p>The aggregated data and analysis results will be released under CC0-1.0 for anyone to use and learn from.</p>

<p>We are looking for volunteers experienced in survey design and translating English into Spanish, Portuguese, 
Russian, Hindi, Mandarin and other languages.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about these volunteer opportunities, or additional ways to support NumPy, feel free 
to reach out to our community coordinators at <b>numpy-team@googlegroups.com</b> or <br>join us on Slack <b>numpy-team.slack.com</b>
