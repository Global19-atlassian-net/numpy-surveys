## PRESENTATION FOR SURVMETH 670
#### Slide 1. Title

#### Slide 3. NumPy - intro

NumPy is a library that adds efficient numerical and array computation to Python. November 2019 marked the 13th anniversary of the release of NumPy 1.0. What started as a humble project by a dedicated core of the user-developers has since transformed into a foundational component of the widely-adopted scientific Python ecosystem, displacing commercially-developed software across many STEM disciplines.
#### Who uses NumPy?
Industry: Google, Netflix, State Farm, Walmart, Amazon, Tesla
<br>
Research: NASA, NIH, Mayo Clinic, BIDS, University of Michigan
<br>
Education: most courses on Data Science or Machine Learning with Python

<br>

#### Slide 4. Infographic "The NumPy Project 101" + Slide 5. Image "Google Trends"
Key ideas and thoughts:
1. The recent explosion of interest in data science and machine learning has accelerated the pace of adoption of NumPy, resulting in an estimated 10-15 million users from a wide range of fields. 
2. Despite its significance and maturity, NumPy is supported largely by 10-15 active maintainers, most of whom are volunteers.

<br>

#### Slide 6. Problem Statement
Having limited human and financial resources is a common challenge for open source projects. The NumPy leadership team would like to gain a better understanding of the ever-growing NumPy user community, their experiences, and expectations for the project. This insight will help the team to better guide and prioritize decision-making about the development of NumPy as software and a community.

<br>

#### Slide 7. Objectives of the Community Survey
**Listen** Invite all NumPy stakeholders to share their thoughts about NumPy as software and as a community project.

**Gain insights** We hope the collected dataset will provide us with a better understanding of the ever-growing NumPy user and contributor community, their experiences with NumPy and within the entire open source ecosystem.

**Take action** Develop (or refine) policies, processes, and practices that will help to strengthen and grow the NumPy community.

<br>

#### Slide 8. Guiding Principles

The following principles will guide the inaugural NumPy Community Survey:

*   Transparency
*   Confidentiality
*   Sustained Action

<br>

**Transparency** We are informed and motivated by the principles of open source and open data. Our primary deliverable for this project is a dataset on backgrounds, experiences, motivations, and other attitudinal data related to the NumPy community that is freely available to all stakeholders and interested parties.

**Confidentiality** We always prioritize the privacy and safety of respondents, and the scientific rigor of the survey design and fielding process. Where these come into conflict with the principle of transparency, we err on the side of privileging respondent privacy and the scientific integrity of the data collection process.
Releasing the data publicly entails tradeoffs in order to maintain respondent privacy, mostly in the form of the kinds of data we can collect and release. We aim not to collect any personally identifying information, such as email addresses. In the event that identifying information is provided, such as in open responses, we will remove it before releasing the data publicly. Some data, such as gender, is not directly identifying and has been widely requested, but when combined with other data, may make respondents identifiable. Though we hope and intend to release all of the data that we collect, we may withhold data if necessary to prevent identification of individuals.

**Sustained action** This survey is a tool for a meaningful and structured dialogue with all stakeholders of the NumPy project. The work begins, not ends, with survey results. The true value of the collected data is in driving positive and sustainable change within the NumPy community with more efficiency and impact.

#### Slide 9. Topics & Questions

This is an **overview of the topics** we would like to explore with the inaugural NumPy Community Survey:

* Community Demographics 

* Contribution 

* Mentorship 

* Project Priorities 

* Future of NumPy

<br>

**NumPy Community Demographics** NumPy has an estimated 10-15 million users. How representative is the NumPy community of the scientific computing and open source communities?

What field of science has the largest number of NumPy users? And what industry?

What is their programming experience?

What do they use NumPy for?

We know NumPy was used to image a black hole. What other major scientific and commercial projects depend on NumPy?

Why do users choose NumPy over other available alternatives?

To what extent are they engaged with, or even aware of, the NumPy development and maintenance, and the philosophy and values of open source software?

**Contribution** NumPy is supported largely by 10 active maintainers. (Not bad for a project with 10-15 million users!) To continue maintaining it and add significant new features that support our user base and the whole ecosystem, we need a lot more help from the open source community. Besides programming and writing documentation, we are looking for volunteers experienced in web development, marketing, community coordination, fundraising and grant writing, developing educational materials, and much more. Therefore we would like to find out the following:

Why do people decide to contribute to open source?

How do they choose a project for contribution?

Why have they chosen to contribute to NumPy?

What prevents them from contributing to NumPy?

**Mentorship** Mentorship is critical to open source community sustainability and growth. What motivates experienced contributors to become mentors, and how do they select mentees?

How do beginners connect with mentors within the open source community?

**Project Priorities** What do NumPy users and contributors deem to be high priority for the NumPy project in the next 12 months (e.g. specific new features, documentation, website, performance, reliability, packaging, etc.)?

**Future of NumPy** What kind of future do NumPy users and contributors envision for the NumPy project (further applications, maintenance model, etc.)?

<br>

#### Translations

Our goal is to write the survey instrument with global audiences in mind and avoid North American -centric concepts or terminology. Furthermore, we will make the survey available in the following languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, and Japanese. Responses in English for the open questions will be encouraged for easy survey processing.

<br>

#### Survey Results

The aggregated data and analysis results will be released under CC0-1.0 for anyone to use and learn from.
