## PRESENTATION FOR SURVMETH 670

#### Slide 1. Intro
NumPy is the open source foundational package for scientific computing in the Python programming language. November 2019 marked the 13th anniversary of the release of NumPy 1.0. What started as a humble project by a dedicated core of the user-developers has since transformed into a foundational component of the widely-adopted scientific Python ecosystem, displacing commercially-developed software across many STEM disciplines.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Key ideas and thoughts:</span>

1. The recent explosion of interest in data science and machine learning has accelerated the pace of adoption of NumPy, resulting in an estimated 10-15 million users from a wide range of fields. 

2. We hope to get better data for the right half of the image after the completion of this survey.

3. Despite its significance and maturity, NumPy is supported largely by 10-15 active maintainers, most of whom are volunteers.

<br>

#### Slide 3. Who uses Numpy?
NASA, Google, Netflix, Walmart, Amazon, BIDS, University of Michigan and many other well-known and highly-reputable institutions and companies.

<br>

#### Slide 4. Problem Statement
Having limited human and financial resources is a common challenge for open source projects. The NumPy leadership team would like to gain a better understanding of the ever-growing NumPy user community, their experiences, and expectations for the project. This insight will help the team to better guide and prioritize decision-making about the development of NumPy as software and a community.

<br>

#### Slide 5. Objectives of the Community Survey
**LISTEN** Invite all NumPy stakeholders to share their thoughts about NumPy as software and as a community project.

**GAIN INSIGHTS** We hope the collected dataset will provide us with a better understanding of the ever-growing NumPy user and contributor community, their experiences with NumPy and within the entire open source ecosystem.

**TAKE ACTION** Develop (or refine) policies, processes, and practices that will help to strengthen and grow the NumPy community.

<br>

#### Slide 6. Guiding Principles

The following principles will guide the inaugural NumPy Community Survey:

*   Transparency
*   Confidentiality
*   Sustained Action

<br>

#### Slide 7. Topics & Questions

This is an **overview of the topics** we would like to explore with the inaugural NumPy Community Survey:

Community Demographics 

Contribution 

Mentorship 

Project Priorities 

Future of NumPy

<br>

_NumPy Community Demographics_

NumPy has an estimated 10-15 million users. How representative is the NumPy community of the scientific computing and open source communities?

What field of science has the largest number of NumPy users? And what industry?

What is their programming experience?

What do they use NumPy for?

We know NumPy was used to image a black hole. What other major scientific and commercial projects depend on NumPy?

Why do users choose NumPy over other available alternatives?

To what extent are they engaged with, or even aware of, the NumPy development and maintenance, and the philosophy and values of open source software?

_Contribution_

NumPy is supported largely by 10-15 active maintainers. (Not bad for a project with 10-15 million users!) To continue maintaining it and add significant new features that support our user base and the whole ecosystem, we need a lot more help from the open source community. Besides programming and writing documentation, we are looking for volunteers experienced in web development, marketing, community coordination, fundraising and grant writing, developing educational materials, and much more. Therefore we would like to find out the following:

Why do people decide to contribute to open source?

How do they choose a project for contribution?

Why have they chosen to contribute to NumPy?

What prevents them from contributing to NumPy?

_Mentorship_

Mentorship is critical to open source community sustainability and growth. What motivates experienced contributors to become mentors, and how do they select mentees?

How do beginners connect with mentors within the open source community?

_Project Priorities_

What do NumPy users and contributors deem to be high priority for the NumPy project in the next 12 months (e.g. specific new features, documentation, website, performance, reliability, packaging, etc.)?

_Future of NumPy_

What kind of future do NumPy users and contributors envision for NumPy (further applications, maintenance model, etc.)?

<br>

#### Slide 8. Translations

In order to reach out to the wider NumPy community, we would like to make the survey available in the following languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Chinese and other languages. Responses in English for the open questions will be encouraged for easy survey processing.

<br>

#### Slide 9. Survey Results

The aggregated data and analysis results will be released under CC0-1.0 for anyone to use and learn from.
