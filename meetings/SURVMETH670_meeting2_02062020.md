There are two options available: pre-testing and a pilot study.

_Pilot study:_ conducting a research study in its entirety, but on a smaller scale.

_Pre-test:_ testing one or a few components of a research study on a small fraction of your sample size.

_Goals of pre-testing:_



*   receive feedback on survey questions;
*   test implementation of a survey on a selected platform.

_Pre-testing options:_



*   vignettes;
*   respondent debriefing;
*   expert evaluation.

To have pre-testing done via respondent debriefing is preferred by the NumPy team. The NumPy core team will serve as respondents.
