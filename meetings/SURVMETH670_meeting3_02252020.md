<br>

**MEETING MINUTES**

**1. Questionnaire comments**

A lot of meaningful comments and suggestions were submitted to the first draft of the survey questionnaire. SMT has incorporated the feedback into the v2.0 document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nbTH-mnLiQM9Bd77i_h3WG7qTaEbQDOOul1xXQ37bCw/edit?usp=sharing

Some questions require additional input from the NumPy Team. Ross and Inessa will address them ASAP.



**2. Sampling Plan**

_Deliverables by SMT:_

*   Fielding instructions
*   Sampling plan

The pretesting to be completed before the next NumPy community meeting on March, 5th, 2020.

*Questions to address during the meeting:*

- Is the length of the survey appropriate?

- Is the introduction page adequate?

- What overarching questions would we like to answer from these survey results (i.e. What percent of respondents have contributed to NumPy)? Are there survey questions that address each of these desired questions? 

- Are there any questions that could be removed?

*Note:* In web surveys longer than 5+ minutes, “breakoff” is very common where respondents give up and stop answering questions. It is important to remove all non-essential questions to avoid this.



**3. Translations**

_Deliverables by SMT:_


*   Bibliography
*   Considerations

**4. Data Analysis and Presentation**

_Deliverables by SMT:_


*   Codebook
*   Instructions for creating public use data file
*   Sample statement about survey and data collection methods to provide with analysis results
