# SURVMETH 670 - Team Meeting 1
### Team Introduction - 01-28-2020

It was great meeting everyone today! I'm very excited to get this project underway and look forward to see where we end up.

Documents from meetings (e.g. this summary) will be kept in the GitHub
repository.
We'll see whether or not collaborating on documents via GitHub ends up being
useful - if not, no problem!

## Team members & contact info

A quick summary of the introductions and points-of-contact for the `numpy-survey` project.
I've excluded email addresses since this is going on the public GitHub repo.

# Meeting Summary

Introductions and initial Q&A to try to scope out the problem and determine next steps for the project. A summary of some of the larger themes:
 1. **Project Scope**
    The numpy team envisions a complete end-to-end project, from survey
    design, distribution, collection, and analysis and publication of the
    data. We need to determine how to concretely map these goals into a 
    reasonably-scoped semester project for the SMT, particularly accounting
    for the interests and expertise of the SMT.
    
 2. **Pilot Study**
    Is there interest/value in conducting a pilot study?
    **Pros**
     - Opportunity to iterate on/refine questionnaire
     - Test distribution, collection, and analysis of data
     - Maps well to a semester project

    **Unknowns**
     - Do we have a "target audience" that we could use for a pilot study?
     - Doesn't address "cluster sampling" and "stratification" of wider
       community of users
       
 3. **Survey Distribution**
    Quite a few open questions regarding the proposed distribution
    mechanism and timeframe. 
     * Target date for distribution (full community and/or pilot study)
     * Period that survey will be open
     * Repeat interval - yearly survey?
     * Release mechanism: PyData groups? Coincident with conferences
       (e.g. SciPy or PyData)? 
       
    NumPy team needs to brainstorm here and come up with concrete
    suggestions/constraints.
       
 4. **Software for Survey**
    Survey design and distribution via Qualtrics software.
    **Pros**
     * SMT familiar with tools and have access to software
     * Provides response analytics (skipped questions, response times, etc.)
    
    **Cons**
     * Commercial/enterprise software; doesn't appear to be open source
       - Can survey data be exported to common database formats or are the
         results locked into some proprietary ecosystem?
     * Will we have a license? Sustainability of relying on non-open platform
       in the future?
 
## Additional considerations

Interesting discussion around sampling techniques (e.g. "cluster sampling") to try to get responses that are representative of various groups (i.e. users, user-contributors, active contributors, etc.). Also would like to account for evaluating "trends" for repeat surveys, which entails incorporating a set of questions that remain consistent across releases of the survey. 



# Action items
 - [x] Set up meeting for next week (aim for PM of Thurs. 2/6) with SMT and Ross+Inessa
   * See [meeting 2 minutes](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys/blob/master/meetings/SURVMETH670_meeting2_02062020.md)

Before the next meeting, the NumPy team will:
 - [x] Brainstorm on survey release timeline and mechanism to provide more 
       clarity to the SMT.
 - [x] Discuss the merits of a pilot study, and whether there is a group that
       could be used for the pilot.

Before the next meeting, the SMT will:
 - [x] Take a first pass at the [sample questionnaire](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-surveys/blob/master/NumPy-survey-questionnaire.md) to begin 
       the process of formalizing the questionnaire. Specific questions and 
       feedback welcome.
